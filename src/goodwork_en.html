                    GoodWork is a project that aims to help individuals manage their mental health at work and also companies to monitor the general culture of the environment and the satisfaction climate of their employees. The main concept uses 6 characters who represent the value areas that contextualize the lives of the participants. With this concept in mind, questionnaires were developed in which the user can evaluate their relationship with the value areas, their mood and everyday feelings, in addition to obtaining suggestions to improve them. The GoodWork Valou project was developed by Bridge Management Technologies® and partner companies.

                    <h3>Challenge</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the initial phase, efforts were focused on launching the MVP of the Valou application, the main channel of contact with individuals, which aims to encourage user interaction with the functionalities for collecting data and proposals for improvements in their routines. The main challenge was to adapt the methodologies consolidated by consultancy work for companies, carried out by Bridge-MT® partners, to a value proposition that would encourage employee participation with the application. The features with the most value delivery were prioritized due to the short deadline.

                    <h3>My role</h3>
                    <p>
                        The project involved a team of 2 designers, a main dev and stakeholders from the companies involved. My role was to collect documentation, generate flowcharts, describe requirements and documentation, create styleguides, create high-fidelity prototypes and support the dev team. In addition to participating in meetings with stakeholders to make decisions.

                    <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>
                        The project began with stakeholder interviews to collect requirements and evaluate initial documentation. Subsequently, a series of flowcharts and a Job map were created to map the main functionalities. Then the styleguide and prototype creation phase began, carrying out consultations and iterations with the dev team and stakeholders. In the implementation phase, some adjustments continued to be made in constant communication with the rest of the team.
